BibDesk2Endnote
===============

Bibdesk2Endnote provides a 1-way synchronisation from BibDesk to Endnote X6 using AppleScript.  You should edit the script to point at your Bibtex file and at an (initially empty) Endnote library. 

Forks welcome, use at your own risk.  No warranty expressed or implied.  

UPDATE: I do not use Endnote any longer, so it is unlikely that there will be further updates to this code.
